Event Management System - Developer Project Report

1. Introduction & Vision
For this assignment, I developed a comprehensive "God Mode" Event Management Dashboard. The goal was to move beyond a simple CRUD application and build a robust tool that handles one of the most complex aspects of efficient scheduling: coordination across multiple timezones.

The application allows an admin to manage users, assign events, and tracking updates in real-time, ensuring that a user in Tokyo and a user in New York see the exact same event relative to their local time.

2. Core Architecture & Tech Stack
I chose the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for its flexibility and performance.
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas) was used for its schema-less nature, allowing us to store complex event objects and nested arrays for assigned profiles.
- Backend: A streamlined Express.js API handles all logic, including a specialized "Profile" and "Event" controller.
- Frontend: React (Vite) provides a snappy, single-page experience. I deliberately avoided CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, opting for "Vanilla CSS" with a custom Design System (variables for colors, spacing, etc.) to demonstrate strong fundamental CSS skills.

3. Key Features Implementation

A. The "Timezone" Challenge
The most critical requirement was ensuring that an event created in EST appears correctly for a user in IST.
- Solution: I utilized `dayjs` with the `timezone` and `utc` plugins. All events are stored in the database as UTC ISO strings. On the frontend, we dynamically convert these strings to the user's selected "View Timezone" in real-time. This means if you change the dropdown from "New York" to "London," every event on the screen instantly shifts to the correct local time without a page reload.

B. Profile Management (The "God Mode" UI)
Instead of a separate, clunky "Manage Users" page, I integrated profile management directly into the workflow.
- Implementation: The "Assigned To" dropdown in the event form is a custom-built multi-select component. It includes an integrated search bar and a seamless "+ Add New Profile" feature. This allows the admin to create a new user on the fly while creating an event, significantly reducing friction.

C. Search and Filtering
To manage clutter, I added a global "Context Switcher" in the top header. This allows the admin to view the dashboard as if they were a specific user (e.g., "Show me only User 1's events"), or view everything at once.

4. Bonus Features & "Extra Credit"

I wanted to push the application further than the basic requirements, so I implemented a sophisticated "Audit Log" system.

A. Detailed Event History
Standard apps just tell you "Event Updated." I built a diffing engine on the backend that compares the old event state vs. the new state.
- Result: The log displays human-readable sentences like "Start Time changed from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM" or "Title changed from 'Meeting' to 'Strategy Call'."

B. Timezone-Aware Logs
Crucially, these logs are not static. If an event was updated at 5:00 PM EST, and you switch your view to London time, the log timestamp also updates to display when that change happened in London time. This ensures absolute clarity in cross-team communication.

5. User Experience (UX) Polish
- No Browser Popups: I replaced all native `alert()` and `prompt()` calls with custom-designed Toast Notifications (for success/error messages) and inline input fields.
- Brand Consistency: The application features a consistent "Purple & Slate" color theme (`#7c3aed`) with a modern, glass-like aesthetic for dropdowns and cards.

6. Conclusion
This project represents a production-ready approach to event management. It handles the "happy path" of creating events, but also handles the edge cases of timezone math, detailed auditing, and user management with a level of polish that users expect from modern SaaS applications.
